                During my Bachelor's I found myself more inclined towards programming and have decided to become a programmer. 
                After my Bachelor's I worked as Advisor at [24]7.ai in Bengaluru, providing technical support for the services of our client (Singtel Optus Pvt Ltd),
            before joining Gratian Technologies, a startup in my hometown, as a Software Engineer Trainee.
            At Gratian Technologies, I worked on SCPP an application used to transfer files between two remote servers, and
